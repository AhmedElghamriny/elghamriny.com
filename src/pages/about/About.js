              <h2>Who am I?</h2><br></br>
              <p>I'm a Computer Science graduate from Dalhousie University with a passion for machine learning. I am driven by a deep curiosity about how data and mathematics shape our world and a desire to harness data to build intelligent, transformative systems. I find alot of excitement in developing models that can learn, adapt, and make predictions (as we humans do) with the challenge of solving complex problems through algorithms and insights.</p>
